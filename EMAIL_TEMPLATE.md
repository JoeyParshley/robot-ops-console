## Email Body

Hi [Recruiter Name],

Thank you for moving forward with my application for the Senior Frontend Engineer role at Alert Venture Foundry. I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to AVF's mission of developing groundbreaking technologies.

Over the weekend, I built a proof-of-concept application that I believe directly aligns with the type of work I'd be doing at AVF. It's a **Robot Operations Console**—a desktop application for monitoring and controlling tethered flying robots, similar to what I understand AVF's robotics ventures might need.

**GitHub Repository**: [Your GitHub Repo URL]

The project demonstrates:
- **TypeScript-first development** for type safety in safety-critical operations
- **Custom React hooks** for reusable business logic (real-time telemetry, robot controls)
- **Modern state management** using React Context API
- **Electron desktop deployment** with security best practices
- **Test-driven development** with comprehensive test coverage

I used GitHub Projects to manage the weekend sprint, and the codebase is fully documented. There's also an **Executive Summary** in the repo (`EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`) that provides a quick 2-minute overview if you'd like to share it with the hiring manager.

**To Run Locally:**
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install && cd server && npm install && cd ..`
3. Start the telemetry simulator: `cd server && npm start`
4. In another terminal, run: `npm run electron:dev`

Alternatively, I can provide a pre-built Electron app if that's easier. The code is well-commented and uses TypeScript throughout, so it should be straightforward to explore.

Regarding the salary discussion: I mentioned my requirements were negotiable, and I'm open to discussing a range that works for both AVF and myself. I'm genuinely excited about this role and the opportunity to work with AVF's innovative team.

I look forward to discussing this project and my fit for the role in more detail during the interview.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

## Alternative Shorter Version

Hi [Recruiter Name],

I wanted to share a weekend project I built that I believe aligns with the Senior Frontend Engineer role at AVF: a **Robot Operations Console** for monitoring and controlling tethered flying robots.

**GitHub**: [Your GitHub Repo URL]

The project showcases TypeScript, custom React hooks, state management, and Electron desktop deployment—all relevant to the work at AVF. There's an Executive Summary in the repo for a quick overview.

I'm open to discussing salary further and am excited about the opportunity to contribute to AVF's mission.

Looking forward to the interview!

Best,

## Notes

- **Include Electron App?** Yes, mention it as optional. Most hiring managers prefer exploring code, but offering a pre-built binary shows you're considerate of their time.
- **Format**: Plain text email is fine. If you want to be more formal, you can format it as HTML, but plain text is more personal and less likely to be filtered.
- **Salary Negotiation**: The email acknowledges the discussion while remaining positive and flexible. This shows you're reasonable and focused on the opportunity.
- **Timing**: Send this 1-2 days before your interview so they have time to review if interested.
